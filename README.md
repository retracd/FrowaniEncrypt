# FrowaniEncrypt
Just a small starter Python project I have worked on over a few days.

I am finishing up learning Python as I finally am feeling more confident in it. What I am posting is two versions of a program I wrote. The former (testenc.py) being the original command-line program I wrote, it is just an uncompiled .py file. I wanted to make a program that "encrypts" text. Reading the code you will figure out how it works, it first converts the text to ASCII and then muliplies, divides, and subtracts those numbers to then output several two to three digit numbers, either positive or negative. The latter (enctk.py and enctk.exe) being the second version of the program. It therefore features a GUI as I wanted more experience in tkinter (the python library). I know it may not be a super pretty GUI, but I am please on how I implented my origincal code into the GUI. I am bound to further update it as I am passionate for it, though it was mainly just a learning experience for me.

As stated above (this is if the above was too long for you to read), the first file is just a .py that you can run, it is only commandline program. The second (and third) file(s) is my take on a GUI for the first program. One file will be the .py for it, and the other will be a compiled executable. 

IF they are any bugs/issues with either, please state so as I would love to correct them and experience user input.

The name comes from the Polish word for encryption, "szyfrowanie". In both programs you will see versions such as "FrowaniEncrypt v1.3.1". There are other versions but they were early versions of the program that might not have even worked. So I am just uploading the two final versions of the program I made.
